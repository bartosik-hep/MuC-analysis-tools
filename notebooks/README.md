# Notebooks for analysis of simulation results

Collection of Jupyter Notebooks for analysis of different aspects of Muon Collider simulations.  
Typical inputs are `ROOT::TTree` (from LCTuple or custom PyLCIO [drivers](pylcio)) and `ROOT::TH1` objects manipulated and visualised inside the notebooks.
